# expensetracker

For our first project, Levi, Alfredo and I put together an app that will keep track of your profits and losses for a self determined period of time. It purposely requires your full input in order to require self discipline and accountability in order to keep track of your expenditures. In this way, anyone can see how they spend their money and decide how best to become more financially responsible.

Acceptance criteria:

* Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
* Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
* Resolve merge conflicts
* Explain agile software development
* Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
* Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project
